**************************************************************

The program calculates the self-consistent Fermi level and defect
concentrations given a set of formation energies (at VBM).

It is currently designed to work with VASP input i.e. the 
POSCAR for which the DOS has been calculated is required. The
DOS should be present in a file called 'totdos.dat' which
is 2 (or 3 for spin polarised) columned, with energy and DOS
in the columns. The energy scale must be given with the VBM
(or Fermi level for a metal) set to zero (in eV). The DOS is
assumed to be in #states/cell.

frozen-sc-fermi can be used to fix a particular defect 
concentration to a value of interest.

Please see the input files in the example directory, they 
should be self-explanatory.

Any questions please email me (see above).
